# Problem Statement 
Overall Analysis and Objectives:
There are often times when we are sitting in traffic for hours and steadily traffic begins to  dissipate. We wonder to ourselves how traffic could become congested when there are no  apparent signs such as automobile accidents, roadwork, or lane closures. This phenomenon is  known as a phantom traffic jam. This occurs when the dynamic of the traffic flow becomes unstable as the density of traffic increases. Further, small disruptions can amplify and grow into  “stop and go” waves that travel backwards. These common wave occurrences are generated by,  but are not limited to, lane changes, obstacles, bottlenecks, merges, and other discernible causes  (Siebold, 2017). However, the cause for phantom traffic jams is not always due to large volumes  of vehicles. Instantaneous lane changes followed by a reduced stopping distance increase the  likelihood of the formation of these traffic jams. Keeping in mind that roadways are a critical  part of society’s economic and societal infrastructure, this is highly undesirable.  
Phantom traffic jams have been found to result for an average American to travel an extra  54 hours in 2017, a 15 percent increase in the last 5 years. This extra time in traffic wastes 21  gallon of fuel, costing urban travelers $1,080 in both time and fuel consumed. This amount will  total to 8.8 billion hours and 3.3 billion gallons of fuel for a cost of $166 billion for Americans  alone (Schrank,2019). Overall, these factors lead to an increase in air pollution, low fuel  efficiency, and time wasted. In addition, congestion can lead to unnecessary psychological stress  for drivers which can lead to a higher risk of accidents occurring (Wakelin, 2017). By  implementing a small number of autonomous vehicles, less than 5% of total vehicles on the road,  the “stop and go” behavior of traffic can be significantly reduced, fuel efficiency of vehicles can increase, and there will be an increase in overall throughput of roadways (Stern, 2018). To  explore the possibilities of integrating autonomy into traffic flow, minimizing the gap between  testing simulations and full-scale vehicles is critical. Therefore, we will be recreating a benchtop  testbed to help further autonomous vehicle research that was initially established by Dr.  Benjamin Siebold of Temple University’s Mathematics Department.  
Through research, Dr. Siebold’s team has developed a methodology as to how to improve  traffic flow by capturing non-equilibrium features. This was accomplished by conducting an  experiment in which 22 vehicles drove on a single-lane circular track for 7-10 minutes at a time.  All the drivers in this experiment were asked to drive in a safe manner and to attempt to close  any distances between their vehicle and the vehicle ahead of them. During testing, traffic waves  began to emerge due to the collective dynamics of the drivers on the track. One of the vehicles  was a connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV), which has the capability to be controlled  manually and autonomously. Once the CAV vehicle was switched into autonomous mode, the  traffic waves dissipated. Therefore, proving that these waves can be reduced by controlling a  small number of vehicles in traffic.  
The team will build 10+ vehicles with different driver model characteristics and validate  their control algorithm using data collected from prior tests conducted using full-scale vehicles.  Autonomous vehicles are being tested on closed and public roadways which is necessary for  hardware and software validation, but it is difficult, expensive, and dangerous. Simulations will  ideally address this issue. This project bridges the gap between the two and allows researchers to  test algorithms on hardware and examine the effects on the individual vehicle and the overall  traffic level.
Historical Perspectives:
As automotive technology rapidly advances, vehicles are being redesigned to improve the  driver’s experience and overall behavior. Engineers and researchers have done so by  implementing forms of lower-level automation. Lower-level automation includes adaptive cruise control, steering control, and acceleration/deceleration control. In addition, some automotive  manufacturers have gone as far as to implement environmental detection capabilities, which  programs the vehicle to “make” decisions. However, these decisions may be overridden by the  driver (“The 6 Levels of Vehicle Autonomy Explained”, 2019). While these improvements have  made strides in driver experience, driver behavior ceases to have been greatly affected by the  implementation of autonomy. Furthermore, driver behavior is a main contributor to waves to  phantom traffic jams. However, through the implementation CAVs, traffic patterns may be better  controlled; therefore, alleviating unnecessary time delays, fuel consumption and improving  overall road safety.  
Currently, researchers have attempted to model traffic through various simulations.  Despite this, there has proven to be a discontinuity between computer simulations of traffic  models and experiments with real vehicles (Dames, 2019). This gap limits researchers' ability to  predict the accuracy of computer simulations. While experiments with humans prove to be more  accurate, they can be costly and time consuming. By using robots to replicate real-life  experiments, researchers will be able to better validate the results of computer simulations.  Further, it is imperative for the safety of society that researchers understand the potential  outcomes that CAVs may have on traffic flow as past results have been unable to capture the  potential challenges. Through this project, the team will bridge together mathematics, science, and engineering technology by establishing a scaled testbed that can accurately simulate micro level vehicle dynamics.
Potential Solutions:
In the past, many efforts have been made to manage traffic flow. A common method to  solving this problem is to redesign traffic facilities on the microlevel. More specifically, this can  be accomplished by dividing roads, expanding the width of lanes, reducing the area of  intersections, changing the timing of the traffic signals, or altering turning lanes. Each of these  methods serves to improve the efficiency of roadways. In addition, it increases the safety of  traveling by decreasing the likelihood of a traffic jam occurring (Gan, 2009). Computer  simulations have shown that the redesign of traffic facilities reduces travel time by 20%,  increases traffic capacity by 15%, and reduces risk of accidents by 80% (Gan, 2009). However,  computer simulations can be unreliable. From a financial standpoint, the cost of roadway  construction can cost upwards of $3 million in urban areas (Russell, 2020). In addition, the  amount of time construction can take is unpredictable, especially in areas where the change in  seasons may prevent roadwork from being completed. On the social level, the level of  inconvenience in roadway construction for commuters needs to be considered due to the inevitable delays and detours. Further, other means to manage traffic patterns have been  implemented to eliminate the need for road construction.  
For instance, this may be achieved through the implementation of detection systems.  These systems include image processing, sensing techniques, and probe-vehicle techniques.  Through image processing, the density of traffic may be captured through a photo or video.  However, this technique has its limitations as the cameras can be highly sensitive to changes in  light or weather. In addition, the level of computation required to evaluate the density of traffic
from an image is highly complex (Ishikawa, 2015). By using sensing techniques, the density of  traffic may be captured; however, this is accomplished through various types of sensors placed  on roadways. Sensor implementation presents many challenges due to the frequent need for  maintenance, being negatively affected by unpredictable climate change, and the deterioration of  pavement over time (Ishikawa, 2015). 
The last type of detection method is using probe-vehicles to collect data in real time. By  using the global positioning system (GPS) of the probe-vehicle, data regarding road networks  may be collected and divided into segments. Further, “temporal and spatial speed traces within  each segment are computed to categorize traffic within [a given] segment as congested or free  flowing” (Ishikawa, 2015). However, the rapid increase in use of GPS interferes with the  accuracy of the data collected, thus this method is not preferable. On the social level, detection  systems are not highly intrusive on human activity. 
Aside from actual methods to reduce the waves in traffic flow, testbeds utilizing small robots to simulate urban traffic flow have been created. An example of this would be the  Duckietown project. Duckiebots use computer vision to drive in lanes, avoid objects, and  navigate intersections. These robots also have the capability to follow lanes and detect path  markings (“The Platform of Duckietown”, 2020). While the concept of the Duckietown project  was insightful, the use of their simulation is not applicable to the project’s purpose because it  does not address the driving behaviors of traffic jams or meet the dynamic scaling requirements.  In addition, Duckiebots cost of $250 per robot which make them an undesirable option for those  trying to keep the research cost low (Paull and Tani, 2017). 
Through the use of robots similar to Duckiebots, a scaled simulation with CAV implementation can further prove how traffic may be better managed and reduce the need for
thoroughfare redesign or detection systems. In addition, the implementation of CAVs can  eliminate the costs associated with roadway construction and implementation of traffic flow  detection systems. However, the human psychology aspect of incorporating autonomy into the  everyday lives of drivers on the road is unpredictable as opinions on accepting autonomy varies.  In addition, drivers would need to learn to accept and adjust to having unmanned vehicles on the  road. Guidance regarding the interaction with these vehicles will be required.
